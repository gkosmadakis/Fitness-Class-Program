# Fitness-Class-Program

This is a java project completed for the course of Java Programming for my master's degree in my University.

It is a Fitness Class program where the user can add and delete fitness classes and see the attendances in each class.

In detail the functionalities are:

1. View fitness classes as well as their attendances.

2. Add a new Fitness Class that will initially have 0 attendances.

3. Delete a Fitness Class and its attendances. To delete a class, you will need
the id of each class. So for the existing ones the id's are jy1 for yoga, 
lb1 for badminton, mp1 for pilates, mp2 for pilates and ls1 for step.

4. View in a separate window all the classes, tutors, attendances of each class and overall average attendance.

5. The application when exits writes to the file AttendancesOut the current
classes and their attendances. It is recommended to end the application by
pressing the Save & Exit button. Otherwise there might be problems when trying to launch it again.
